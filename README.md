# Enhanced To-Do List Application with Spring Boot and MySQL for Code Review and Testing

This project is a simple Spring Boot-based To-Do List application, primarily focused on code review and performance optimization of Java code translated from C#. It utilizes Spring JPA and MySQL for robust data management and employs Thymeleaf for dynamic frontend rendering. 

Key objectives include:

- Rigorous code review to refine and optimize the translated Java code.
- Comprehensive unit testing of critical functions using GitHub Copilot.
- Performance analysis to ensure efficient operation.

To build and run the sample from a fresh clone of this repo:

## Configure MySQL

1. Create a database in your MySQL instance.
2. Update the application.properties file in the `src/main/resources` folder with the URL, username and password for your MySQL instance. 
3. The table schema for the Todo objects will be created for you in the database.

Note: Requires Java 11 JDK.
